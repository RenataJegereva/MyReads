# MyReads Project
### props threading

The project is overcommented, which is not a reflection of a real-life scenario. The sole purpose of the vast number of comments is to demonstrate my thorough understanding of ReactJS UI rendering, state management and basic lifecycle as relevant to the level of knowledge required by the 'React' part of the course.

===================================================================

The project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## Install and run

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
