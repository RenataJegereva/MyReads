# MyReads Project

The project is overcommented, which is not a reflection of a real-life scenario. The sole purpose of the vast number of comments is to demonstrate my thorough understanding of ReactJS UI rendering, state management and basic lifecycle as relevant to the level of knowledge required by the 'React Fundamentals' part of the course.

GIT comments are concise: most of the information is displayed in the body of the commit message. This has originated from my initial misunderstanding of Udacity GIT styleguide provided. The branching of the project with self-explanatory branch names, all of the succesfull ones of which have been merged back into master, hopefully contain enough insights into my workflow.
